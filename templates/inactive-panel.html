		<p class="bottom-2">
			In Skull Beggar, the streamer opens betting before beginning
			a Binding of Isaac game. Users are allowed to place a bet
			on the enemy they believe will be responsible for the streamer's
			death. The user is also allowed to bet on the streamer winning
			the game. The streamer then must close betting, and play the game
			until they win or lose. If some users guessed correctly, the pot is 
			split evenly between them. If not, bets are returned to the users.

			The app is still in a semi-beta state. It's on a very slow 
			server, so if usage starts going up (say, you're CobaltStreak or
			Lethalfrag or ManVSGame), please notify me so I can buy better
			servers for everyone. If you
			find some bugs, private message me on Twitch, I'm MysteryMachineSA.
