		<p class="bottom-2">
			This app is currently "Hella Beta, Yo". It's been rushed so
			it can be out for people to use on the same day Rebirth comes out. This 
			means stuff is likely broken, and likely to break! Check below for more
			info!

		<div class="bottom-2"> Summary </div>
		<p class="bottom-2">
			In Skull Beggar, the streamer opens betting before beginning
			a Binding of Isaac game. Users are allowed to place a bet
			on the enemy they believe will be responsible for the streamer's
			death. The user is also allowed to bet on the streamer winning
			the game. The streamer then must close betting, and play the game
			until they win or lose. If some users guessed correctly, the pot is 
			split evenly between them. If not, bets are returned to the users.
		</p>
		
		<div class="bottom-2"> Notes </div>
		
		<p class="bottom-2">
			Expect
			shiny new features to be rolled out eventually. Currently, I'm going
			to iron out all the bugs in the current application and then build
			some tests for it. After that, shiny new stuff. If you
			find some bugs, private message me on Twitch, I'm MysteryMachineSA.
